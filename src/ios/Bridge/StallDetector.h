// Decision logic of the video-stall watchdog, kept free of Cemu, Metal and UIKit so it can be compiled
// and tested on any machine (ci/stall-detector-test.cpp). The watchdog thread in CemuBridge.mm turns the
// live counters into a Sample every 250 ms and acts on the Decision that comes back.
//
// What counts as a frozen picture here, and what does not:
//
//   - The game is not sending GPU work (loading screen, a long synchronous load, a hang on the CPU side):
//     the GPU thread sits in an "idle" or guest wait. That is NOT a video freeze. Nothing is raised, one
//     log line says so.
//   - The GPU is not finishing work (command buffers time out and nothing retires), or frames are being
//     made but the screen cannot take them (the layer hands out no drawables): those ARE video freezes.
//   - A command buffer error that iOS answers by ignoring this app's GPU work is certain and is shown at
//     once. Everything else is a heuristic: it has to hold for a whole window, survive a second
//     confirmation a little later, and is dismissed again by itself when progress resumes.
//
// Every rule is written as "counter X has not changed for N seconds" so each decision can be audited from
// the log line it produces, which carries the rule name, the measured ages and the threshold.
